<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>A Full-Stack Developer who specializes in creating beautiful, functional, and accessible user interfaces to pair with web apps that solve real problems. I'm often working on projects that involve Django, HTMX, and the three front-end web technologies (CSS, HTML, JavaScript).</p>
<h1>Back End Development</h1>
<h2>Django</h2>
<p>My passion for web development begain when I <code>pip install</code>d Django and started my first project <strong>4 years ago</strong>. I've followed many online tutorials and created my own <a href="https://smattymatty.notion.site/Django-ff0fa4854ec44d7095805c4d4d6f79cb?pvs=4">cheat sheet</a> that I used while learning.
The more I played with Django, and read through their documentation, the more I realized how powerful and flexible it is, and the less I had to rely on the cheat sheet.</p>

<h2>DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>I've been using DigitalOcean for the past year, and I'm very happy with it. It's user experience is fantastic and inspiring, and their documentation and tutorials are easy to follow. The content you are reading right now is hosted on DigitalOcean, and you can see the source code <a href="TODO: add link">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>I've been using Linux for the past year, Linux Mint has been my daily driver. I enjoy the customization and the simplicity of the interface. I also enjoy the fact that I can use the terminal to do everything I need to do.</p>
<p><strong>Gunicorn</strong> and <strong>Docker</strong> are mainly available for Linux, that's why I began using it. Over the past year I've switched entirely to Linux and I'm very happy with it.</p>
<h1>Front End Development</h1>
<h2>HTMX</h2>
<p>This is the newest piece of technology in my arsenal, and I've been using it for the past year. It makes beautiful use of the simplicity of original HTML, and allows you to create interactive web applications without the need for JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button
  hx-get=&quot;/api/get-data&quot;
  hx-swap=&quot;outerHTML&quot;
  hx-target=&quot;#data-container&quot;
  hx-trigger=&quot;mousedown&quot;
&gt;
  Get Data
&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;data-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>An example how it meshes with HTML's original simplicity. With just four extra attributes, you can create a button that fetches data from an API, and inserts that data without reloading the page.</p>

<h2>CSS and HTML</h2>
<p>I started learning CSS through Tailwind. Their utility classes were a good entry point into the world of CSS, but lately I've been developing with just vanilla. I enjoy the freedom of creating my own classes and the pseudoselectors to go along with them.
I have grown to love HTML, and have learned so much about it since I first began my journey. I've learned how to create semantic HTML, and how to use HTML's original simplicity to create beautiful user interfaces.</p>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an important language because it runs natively on the user's web browser. When I started using JavaScript, I saw it as a necessary evil, but the more I used it, the more I realized how powerful and flexible it is.</p>
<p>HTMX is part of my tool-kit not necessarily to entirely avoid JavaScript, but to combine the two technologies to create robust and interactive single-page applications that are accessible to all users.</p>
